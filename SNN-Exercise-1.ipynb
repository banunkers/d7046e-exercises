    "# 1 Introduction to Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) â€“ D7046E @ LTU.SE\n",

    "The figure below illustrates a single neuron, see [Figure 1.2A](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S1.html) in Neuronal Dynamics. The dendrite, soma, and axon can be clearly distinguished.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Neuron](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurons communicate via action potentials that propagate along axons (nerves) to synapses on the dendrites of the target/receiving neurons. The most important feature of an action potential is the **time** when it occurs, while their amplitudes and shapes are similar. In spiking neuron models, action potentials are represented by discrete events called **spikes** that are defined by the time of occurrence and some kind of identifier of the source neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiking neuron models mimic natural neurons more closely than the activation-function based *units* of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which operate with *amplitudes* that qualitatively correspond to average spike frequencies. Spiking neurons have time-dependent states and can for example respond differently to two inputs with identical amplitudes but different temporal structure. Spiking neuron models are central in neuroscience and [neuromorphic engineering](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/sections/neuromorphic-engineering).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will investigate and perform numerical experiments with the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model of neurons, see [Figure 1.6A](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html) in the book and the lectures for further information.\n",

    "![LIF model](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x12.png)\n",
    "<!-- ![LIF model](https://lcnwww.epfl.ch/gerstner/SPNM/img378.gif) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In the LIF model we consider the cell membrane (big circle) of the neuron as a capacitor, $C$, that integrates an input current, $I(t)$, of ions from synapses. In addition, there is a parallel branch with a voltage source, $u_{rest}$, and a resistor, $R$, which corresponds to ion pumps and leakage of the cell membrane, respectively. When the membrane voltage, $u(t)$, reaches a threshold voltage, $u_{th}$, a spike is generated and $u(t)$ is reset. See the book for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulators like [Brian2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io) and [Neuronify](https://ovilab.net/neuronify/) can be used to quickly configure and simulate spiking neural networks (SNNs) of LIF neurons. However, in order to develop an understanding of spiking neurons and neural networks you will solve the corresponding differential equations numerically in this exercise. Some sample code is included below to get you started, and the resulting code will be reused in a subsequent SNN exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also investigate the delta modulator receptor neuron model introduced in the lectures, which introduces a central concept used in neuromorphic sensor systems like [dynamic vision sensors](https://inivation.com/dvp/). The receptor neuron model can be used to convert input signals to spikes that can be further processed with an SNN.\n",

    "There are 10 mandatory tasks and a few optional tasks that you can perform to deepen your knowledge."

    "## 1.2 LIF neuron model\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIF model is defined by [Equation 1.5](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html) in the book $$\\tau_m \\frac{du}{dt} = -(u - u_{rest}) + R I_{syn},$$ where $u=u(t)$ is the membrane potential, $R$ is the membrane resistance and $\\tau_m$ is the membrane time constant, which is related to the time constant of the RC electric circuit in the illustration above. Note that $u(t)$ is a voltage difference across the neuron cell membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium potential $u_{rest}\\simeq-65$ mV is determined by the dynamic equilibrium between the ion flow through  channels in the membrane (leakage) and the active ion transport by ion pumps (that maintain a concentration difference). Inside the cell the concentration of ions is different from that in the surrounding liquid. The difference in concentration generates an equilibrium electrical potential called the *Nernst potential* which plays an important role in neuronal dynamics, see [Section 2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S1.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a threshold membrane potential of $u_{\\text th}=-50$ mV and a reset potential of $u_{reset}=u_{rest}$ in the following tasks, unless stated otherwise. Use a membrane time constant of $\\tau_m=30$ ms and a membrane resistance of $R=90$ M$\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_{syn}$ is the total input current to the neuron, which is the sum of postsynaptic currents from all synapses on the neuron. This current can also be defined as a constant injection current to investigate the spike frequency of the LIF neuron for different input currents. This is what you will do in this first task."

See [Figure 3.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch3.S1.html) and the related discussion of time constants for further information. At the time when a presynaptic spike arrives at the synapse the postsynaptic current is updated by the rule $$I_{syn}\\leftarrow I_{syn}+w_{syn},$$ where $w_{syn}$ is the efficacy (weight) of the synapse.

This is an active area of research. See [Section 7.6.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch7.S6.html) for information about different candidate encoding concepts. If you are interested to study the details of sensory neurons and systems, the book [Neuroscience](https://www.bokus.com/bok/9781605358413/neuroscience/) by Dale Purves et. al. is recommended because of the many helpful illustrations and in-depth biological presentations.\n",

This concept is used to map analog voltages and currents to spikes in neuromorphic sensors like [brain machine interfaces](https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2479256) and [neuromorphic vision sensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera).\n",

    "The idea is to measure *differences* in the intensity/amplitude of the signal and generate a spike whenever the intensity increases or decreases by an anount $\\delta$, hence the name *asynchronous delta modulator*. The figure below illustrates the idea. There are two output neurons for each signal in this model, denoted *UP* and *DN*, which fires a spike whenever the intensity increases (UP) or decreases (DN).\n",

The amplitude resolution and average spikerate depends on the parameter $\\delta_y$. This is similar to pulse interval/frequency modulation, which may be familiar if you have studied digital communication.\n",

Whenever the amplitude $y$ has increased by an amount $\\delta_y$ an up spike should be generated. If the amplitude $y$ decreases by an amount $\\delta_y$ a down spike should be generated. The list of generated up and down spike times should be returned from the encoder function. The subsequent example *Encoding a sine wave* and Task 10 should be used to verify that your encoder implementation is correct."
